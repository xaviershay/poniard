Poniard
=======

A lightweight gem that provides an alternative to Rails controllers. It uses
parameter based dependency injection to explicitly make dependencies available,
rather than mixing them all in from a base class. This allows you to properly
unit test your controllers in isolation, bringing all the design benefits of
TDD (as opposed to "test-first" development which is more common with the
standard integration style controller tests).

Poniard is designed to be compatible with standard controllers. You can use it
for your entire application, just one action, or anything in between.

Example
-------

A poniard controller is slightly more verbose than the what you may be used to.
In particular, you need to specify all the different dependencies you wish to
use (`response` and `finder` in this example) as parameters to your method.
Poniard will introspect the method before calling, and ensure that the correct
values are passed. These values will for the most part be the same objects you
normally deal with in Rails (`session`, `flash`, etc...).

The following controller renders the default index template, setting the
instance variables `@message`.

```ruby
module Controller
  class Registration
    def index(response)
      response.default message: "hello"
    end
  end
end
```

This is more explicit than traditional controllers in two ways: passing
variables to the template is done with an explicit method call rather than
instance variable assignment, and dependencies that would normally be made
available by a superclass are passed in as parameters to the method.

Wiring this controller into your application is a one-liner in your normal
controller definition.

```ruby
class RegistrationsController < ApplicationController
  include Poniard::Controller

  provided_by Controller::Registration
end
```

You can mix and match traditional and poniard styles. Some actions can be
implemented in the normal controller, others can be provided by an injectable
one.

```ruby
class RegistrationsController < ApplicationController
  include Poniard::Controller

  # index action provided by this class
  provided_by Controller::Registration

  # All controller features work in harmony with poniard, such as this
  before_filter :require_user

  # update action implemented normally
  def update
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Sources

Poniard knows about all the standard controller objects such as `response`,
`session` and `flash`. You then layer your own domain specific definitions on
top by creating **sources**:

```ruby
class Source
  class Registration
    def finder
      Registration.accepted
    end

    def current_registration
      Registration.find(params[:id])
    end
  end
end
```

Wire this up in the `provided_by` call:

```ruby
provided_by Controller::Registration, sources: [
  Source::Registration
]
```

You can specify as many sources as you like, making it easy to reuse logic
across controllers.

Testing
-------

Set up a common injector for the scope of your controller that knows about
common sources that all tests require (such as `response`). Add extra required
sources on a per test basis (`finder` in the below example).

```ruby
require 'poniard/injector'
require 'controller/registration'

describe Controller::Registration do
  let(:response) { double("Poniard::ControllerSource") }
  let(:injector) { Poniard::Injector.new([OpenStruct.new(
    response: response.as_null_object
  )]) }

  def dispatch(action, overrides = {})
    injector.dispatch described_class.new.method(action), overrides
  end

  describe '#index' do
    it 'should render default action with all registrations' do
      finder = double(all: ['r1'])
      response.should_receive(:default).with(registrations: ['r1'])

      dispatch :index, finder: finder
    end
  end
end
```

Techniques
----------

### Built-in sources

Undocumented, but it is a pretty straight-forward mapping to Rails objects with
the exception of `response`. The code is in `lib/poniard/controller_source.rb`.

### Layouts

If you implement a `layout` method in your controller, it will be used to
select a layout for the controller. This is equivalent to adding a custom
`layout` method to a standard controller.

### Mime types

The Rails `respond_with` API is not very OO, so is hard to test in isolation.
Poniard provides a wrapper that allows you to provide a response object that is
much easier to work with.

```ruby
module Controller
  class Registration
    def index(response, finder)
      response.respond_with RegistrationsIndexResponse, finder.all
    end

    RegistrationsIndexResponse = Struct.new(:registrations) do
      def html(response)
        response.default registrations: registrations
      end

      def json(response)
        response.render json: registrations.to_json
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Authorization

Poniard sources can raise exceptions to indicate authorization failure, which
can then be handled in a standard manner using `rescue_from`.

```ruby
module Source
  class Admin
    def current_organiser(session)
      Organiser.find_by_id(session[:organiser_id])
    end

    def authorized_organiser(current_organiser)
      current_organiser || raise(ResponseException::Unauthorized)
    end
  end
end
```

This can be slightly weird if the method you are authorizing does not actually
need to interact with the organiser, since it will have a method parameter that
is never used.

```ruby
RSpec::Matchers.define :have_param do |attribute|
  match do |obj|
    obj.parameters.map(&:last).include?(attribute)
  end
end

def instance_method(name)
  described_class.new.method(name)
end

it 'requires authorization' do
  instance_method(:index).should have_param(:authorized_organiser)
end
```

Developing
----------

### Status

Experimental. I've backported an existing app, added minor new features, and it
was a pleasant experience. It needs a lot more usage before the API stabilizes,
or it is even proved to be useful.

### Compatibility

Requires 1.9, should be easy to backport to 1.8 if anyone is interested. Use
1.9 style hashes and probably relies on `methods` calls returning symbols
rather than strings.

### Support

Make a [new github issue](https://github.com/xaviershay/poniard/issues/new).

### Contributing

Fork and patch! Please update the README and other documentation if you add
features.
